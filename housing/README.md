With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Implementations :-

1. PCA + GridSearch+ Normalization+ Imputer +KNN = 4000 rank

2. Boosting +GridSearch+ Normalization+ Imputer + PCA = 2000 rank

3. LR model with L1 and L2 regularization with weights modified , no pca but other data preprocessing done :- 1000 rank

4. Same as above but used PCA and log of data rather than the standard scaler : 900 rank

5. Ensembling + XGBoost + Log of data + Imputer = 600 rank

6. Better Ensembling + XGBoost + Data Cleaning = 285 rank
