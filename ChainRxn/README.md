Currently I am working on this project, So this project is incomplete.

**Description** - A 2-player Eectronic board game designed using LEDâ€™s and simulated using arduino. Runs on basic DFS(Depth First Search) algorithm. We analysed critical points(when probability that certain player wins changes by a significant amount) in the game using both Dynamic Programming and Machine Learning and compared them.
